    <p>Arcane Tracker is a tracker for Hearthstone on Android. It uses the Hearthstone log files generated by the game and stored on your phone to help you improve your gameplay. By default Arcane tracker does not require any account to function.</p>

    <p>Hearthstone logs are read by Arcane Tracker to analyze the games you play. These files contain your battle.net tag as well as your opponent's and the details of the cards played during a game. This information is used to build the overlay as well as your win/loss count and game history.</p>

    <p>You can choose to enable trackobot.com or hsreplay.net integrations in which case the game data is directly sent to their respective services without us having access to it.</p>


    <h2>Game history</h2>

    <p>At the end of a game, Arcane Tracker saves a summary of the game to give you access to your win rate and history of games. This summary is stored on a local database located on your device and is not transfered to the Arcane Tracker servers. Only you can access it.</p>

    <h2>Trackobot.com</h2>

    <p>If you enabled Trackobot.com integration, after each game, Arcane Tracker will send a summary of the game to trackobot.com. This summary contains the class of hero you and your opponent played, the mode (ranked/casual/arena), if you had the coin, if you won, the date of the game, your rank (if applicable) and the list of card played every turn.</p>
