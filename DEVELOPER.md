## updating rank_data.json ##

Rank detection is made by image processing, trying to match what is seen on screen to reference data. The reference data is contained inside rank_data.json. 
It is generated by running the algorithm directly on-phone using known rank images (training_data)

To update it from the root of the repo:

    # connect a phone through USB and make sure adb is running and in your path
    ./gradlew :detector:pushTrainingData  #this is needed only once: it will push the rank images to /sdcard on your phone
    ./gradlew :detector:updateRankData -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=net.arcanetracker.detector.GenerateRankData 
    # you should now have the update rank_data in ./detector/src/main/resources/rank_data.json
    
    
## updating hsmodel enums and card database ##

The hsmodel submodule contains the cards database as well as some enums (CardIds, PlayerClass, etc..). It typically needs updating for every patch.

To update it from the root of the repo (This requires [kscript](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript))

    ./scripts/update_card_json.kts
