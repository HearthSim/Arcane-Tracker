## Contributor License Agreement

HearthSim requires a signed CLA from any contributor before his/her PR can be merged.

### What's a CLA?

> A CLA is a legal document in which you state you are entitled to contribute
the code/documentation/translation to the project youâ€™re contributing to and are
willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works. This means that
should there be any kind of legal issue in the future as to the origins and
ownership of any particular piece of code, then that project has the necessary
forms on file from the contributor(s) saying they were permitted to make this
contribution.

> The CLA also ensures that once you have provided a contribution, you cannot try
to withdraw permission for its use at a later date. People and companies can
therefore use that software, confident that they will not be asked to stop using
pieces of the code at a later date.

### Why?

HearthSim uses a Contributor License Agreement to ensure we can legally use,
redistribute and relicense external contributions to our various projects.

### How do I sign it?

Contact any admin on our [Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/hearthsim-devs) or send us an email at contact@hearthsim.net. Please include your Github username.

## Project approval

For trivial changes or fixes (i.e. a couple lines of code) on new or existing issues and projects feel free to just open a PR.

We would like to avoid wasting your time, so for non-trivial changes or fixes please do one of the following before starting to work on it:
- For work on an existing issue please comment on that issue and wait for approval.
- If no issue exists, please open a new issue with the proposal and wait for approval.
- Propose the project in #hdt on the [Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/hearthsim-devs) and wait for approval.

## Commits and Pull Requests

Keep the commit log as healthy as the code. It is one of the first places new contributors will look at the project.

1. No more than one change per commit. There should be no changes in a commit which are unrelated to its message.
2. Follow [these conventions](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) when writing the commit message.
3. Keep the diffs as clean as possible. Avoid unnecessary line changes.

When filing a Pull Request, make sure it is rebased on top of most recent master.
If you need to modify it or amend it in some way, you should always appropriately
[fixup](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/) the issues in git and force-push your changes to your fork.
